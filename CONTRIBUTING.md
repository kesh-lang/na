# Contributing

Oh, you want to contribute? Nice!

If you have any ideas, criticisms (of the constructive kind) or other useful contributions, you're welcome to open an issue or get in touch. I'm interested in hearing what others think of this.

I made it for my own use, but I never meant to keep it to myself.

## Development

1. Clone the repo
2. Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
3. `bun install`

To run tests: `bun test`

To play around with the compiler, feel free to create an `index.ts` file in the root directory (it will be ignored by git) and `bun --watch .` away.
