# Contributing

Oh, so you want to contribute? Nice!

If you have any ideas, criticisms (of the constructive kind) or helpful input of any kind, you're welcome to open an issue or send me a message. I'm interested in hearing what others think of this. While I made it for my own use, I never meant to keep it for myself.

## Dev environment

1. Clone the repo
2. Install [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
3. `bun install`

To run tests: `bun test`

To play around with the compiler, create an `index.ts` file in the root directory (it will be ignored by git) and `bun .` away.
