# Test suite

A basic test suite used during development of the lexer and parser.

It only tests whether valid input produces normalized output.

To test conformance to the specification, much more thorough tests will be required.

To run tests: `bun test`

Note: Percentage numbers are not yet supported, so some tests are expected to fail.
