# Compiler

This is a preliminary and very small handwritten compiler for na.

It's only a start, but it seems to work reasonably well for simple data.

See [test/](../test/) and the files in [data/](../test/data/) (the first line is the expected output of compiling the following lines to normalized na).

Hopefully more to come!
